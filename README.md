# Big Brother

School project around the Facebook API (JS/PHP SDK).

## Installation

A web server must be installed so that the index file can be called by the address looking like *localhost/...* (for example : [localhost/bitbucket/big-brother][1]). The Facebook API won't return any result if the request is made from another address. No Facebook API call will work unless the "site URL" field is changed in the Facebook app configuration. This will be made regularly but will stay to "http://localhost" most of the time to let developers code and test.

## Technologies

  - CoffeeScript
  - Handlebars.js
  - jQuery
  - Underscore.js
  - Twitter Bootstrap

## How to

### Classes

A CoffeeScript class named *Facebook.coffee* has been created in order to use the Facebook JavaScript SDK with some callbacks. Developers can write util method in the Util.coffee class.

### CoffeeScript

If you have not CoffeeScript installed, please [install it][2]. To make CoffeeScript work in this project, you have to go to the project directory.

    cd workspace/big-brother
    coffee -o js/ -cw coffee/

### JavaScript

The JavaScript (generated by CoffeeScript) must not be written directly in the index file. The library Require.js is used to let in manage sources, librairies and dependances. Check the *coffee/init.coffee* file to understand how aliases are created and repect this convention of coding :

    require ['fileAlias'], (File) ->
      # Here, code from File is accessible

### Remote application

A [Heroku application][3] has been created in order to access the application from the Internet.

## Examples of use

### Initialization

    Facebook.login()
      .fail(->
        # Handle login error
      )
      .done((user) ->
        # Some actions
      )

### API request

    Facebook.api('me/likes', 'get',
      limit: 100
    )
      .fail(->
        # Handle request error
      )
      .done((res) ->
        # Some actions
      )
