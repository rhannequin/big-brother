# Big Brother

Facebook application around profile data.

This application was made by [Rémy Hannequin](https://github.com/RemyHannequin), [Bastian Peghaire](https://github.com/2slow) and [Hervé Tran](https://github.com/Jagbomb) during a school project.

## Technologies

  - CoffeeScript
  - Handlebars.js
  - jQuery
  - Underscore.js
  - Twitter Bootstrap

## How to

### Classes

A CoffeeScript class named *Facebook.coffee* has been created in order to use the Facebook JavaScript SDK with some callbacks. Developers can write util method in the Util.coffee class.

### CoffeeScript

If you have not CoffeeScript installed, please [install it][2]. To make CoffeeScript work in this project, you have to go to the project directory.

    coffee -o js/ -cw coffee/

### JavaScript

The JavaScript (generated by CoffeeScript) must not be written directly in the index file. The library Require.js is used to let in manage sources, librairies and dependances. Check the *coffee/init.coffee* file to understand how aliases are created and repect this convention of coding :

    require ['fileAlias'], (File) ->
      # Here, code from File is accessible

### Remote application

A [Heroku application][3] has been created in order to access the application from the Internet.
